Write a program called rotone that takes a string and
display it, replacing each of its letters by the next one
in alphabetical order.

'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'. Case remains unaffected.

The output will be followed by a newline.

If the number of arguments is nor 1, just display a newline.

$> ./rotone "abc" | cat -e
bcd$

$> ./rotone "My horse is Amazing." | cat -e
Nz ipstf jt Bnbajoh.$

$> ./rotone | cat -e
