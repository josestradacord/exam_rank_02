Assignment name	: flood_fill
Expected files	: *.c, *.h
Allowed functions	: 
----------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a char ** as a 2-dimensional
array of char, a t_point as the dimensions of this array
and a t_point as the starting point.

Starting from the given 'begin' t_point, this function
fills an entire zone by replacing characters inside with
the character 'F'. A zone is an group of the same character
delimitated horizontally and vertically by other characters
or the array boundry.

The flood_fill function won't fill diagonally.

The flood_fill function will be prototyped like this:

void  flood_fill(char **tab, t_point size, t_point begin);

The t_point structure is prototyped like this:

typedef struct  s_point
{
int           x;
int           y;
}               t_point;

Example:
$>./test
11111111
10001001
10010001
10110001
11100001
