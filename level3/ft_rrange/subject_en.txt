Assignment name	: ft_rrange
Expected files	: ft_rrange.c
Allowed functions	: malloc
-------------------------------------------

Write a function that allocate (with malloc()) an
array of integers, fill it with consecutive values
that begin at end and end at start (Including start
and end !), then return a pointer to the first value
of the array.


Your function must be declared as follows:

int     *ft_rrange(int start, int end);

Examples:

- With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 3, 2 and 1.
- With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing 2, 1, 0 and -1.
- With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) you will return an array containing -3, -2, -1 and 0.
